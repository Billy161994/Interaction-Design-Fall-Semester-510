  <h1 class="text-md-center"> Biography </h1>
  <p id="band-info" class="bg-dark text-white lead"> Joanne Rowling, CH, OBE, FRSL, FRCPE, writing under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith,
    is a British novelist, philanthropist, film producer, television producer and screenwriter, best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series.
  Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target
  audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman,her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her
  full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name,
  from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo.
   Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.During the Leveson
   Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling</p>

    <h3>Book one</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      The book was first published in the United Kingdom in 1997 by Bloomsbury.
      In 1998, it was published in the United States by Scholastic Corporation
       under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It won most of
       the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US.
        The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in
         August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000.
         It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made
         into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Book two</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
    The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later,
     in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she
     found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics,
     young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was
     perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series,
     Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious
      authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its
      emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result
       of the person's choices.

    <h3>Book four</h3>
